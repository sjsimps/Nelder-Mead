#Nelder-Mead

This is an implementation of the Nelder-Mead multidimensional cost minimization algorithm.
It is implemented in Python.

###Example

![](https://github.com/sjsimps/Nelder-Mead/blob/master/example.png)

The above example plot can be generated using [this code](https://github.com/sjsimps/Nelder-Mead/blob/master/example.py),
which takes a cost function and attempts to find local minima.

The plot's mesh indicates the cost function, and scatter plot
points represent the values searched by the algorithm.
The blue points indicate the results from the beginning of the search, and
the red points show the end results.
